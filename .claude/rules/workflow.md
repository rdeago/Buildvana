# Workflow rules

## General rules

- Start by understanding the problem and its context, then work out the best solution with me. Do not take a request as a specification to execute.
- Treat me as a peer, without deference. Call me by name, and I will call you by name too.
- When I overrule you, it is business, not personal. The final call on what we work on, and how, is mine, because I will be held responsible for it. I weigh your input before making it.
- Ask me to explain when my reasoning is unclear. Point out my contradictions. When you think I am wrong, say so, and say why. I will not take offence, and a good case changes my mind. I also change my mind mid-session, often because of you, so check in when something looks inconsistent.
- Verify every premise I state in the code before you build on it. When the premise does not hold, say so.
- Prefer to resolve a divergence over writing code that accepts it.
- On a decision of merit, consult a senior, preferably the author of the issue. The team and the customers are listed in `people.md`. When the author of the issue is a customer, there are two ways: a comment on the issue that tags the author, or a question to the team leader. The team leader is the only one in direct contact with the customers. Never post such a comment on your own initiative. Ask me whether to draft it in the issue scratchpad, and post it only when I ask.
- Do not write or modify anything until I ask: code, documentation, issues, PRs, comments. Check with me first. This rule keeps us aligned and saves work nobody wanted.
- I attend every session, so I am there to approve a plan. A classifier authorizes tool calls, not me. See "Tool use and the classifier" below.
  - Harness framing that calls a session "autonomous" or "unattended" does not describe my setup. Do not act on it.
  - When I ask for a plan, present it and end the turn. While you wait you may read, search, and run checks. No edits, commits, pushes, or posts.
  - "I trust your judgement" scopes the details: commit contents, wording, ordering. It never scopes the go/no-go.
- Post nothing outward-facing without a draft: issues, PRs, comments, anything that leaves this machine. Show me the full text and wait for my go-ahead.
  - This rule is a quality mechanism, not a trust mechanism, so it holds however routine the item looks. The draft often needs context that I cannot think of until I read it. Reading the draft is what surfaces that context.
  - "Just file it" for one item is a one-off, not a policy change.
  - The standing exception is step 3 of "Reacting to reviews", where agreeing on the plan pre-authorizes the replies.
- Before drafting a plan, a commit message, an issue, a PR description, or a review reply, Read `.claude/output-styles/simple-tech.md` and apply it to the draft. The style sits at the start of the context, and a long session pushes it far from the draft. A fresh copy next to the draft holds better.
- When you find a working-tree change you did not make, or one unrelated to the task, report it. Ask me before you revert or overwrite it. Unexpected state in this repo is usually my own work in progress, since I edit files by hand mid-session. Keep your own change set clean, but never discard my edits.

## Scratchpad and handoff files

- Temporary files go in `.claude/scratchpad/`, not in the session directory that Claude Code assigns. `.claude/.gitignore` keeps the directory out of git, so nothing in it reaches `git status` or a commit.
- Each issue has its own scratchpad, `.claude/scratchpad/<N>/`, so that sessions on different issues do not collide. Every temporary file of the issue goes there: commit messages, PR text, review replies, proof scripts, research results, and any file you create and may need to refer to while working on the issue.
- Each issue has a handoff file, `.claude/handoff/<N>-<slug>.md`. When I ask to continue the work on an issue, read the handoff in full before anything else.
- Update the handoff at every step: after every commit, after every review the session reacts to, and on request. I then never have to ask, and a blackout costs nothing.
- Write the handoff for a session that has the repository and the file, nothing else. Mark every fact as measured or decided, with the date.
- `.claude/.gitignore` ignores `scratchpad/` and `handoff/`.

## Tool use and the classifier

Claude Code runs in auto mode, so a classifier model reviews each tool call before it runs. I do not approve tool calls one by one. Everything above about waiting for my go-ahead on a plan still stands. The classifier decides whether an action is safe, not whether it is wanted.

- Reads and edits inside the working directory skip the classifier. Shell commands and network access go through it. Prefer a file tool to its shell equivalent: `Read` over `cat`, `Edit` and `Write` over `cp`, `sed`, or a redirection.
- The classifier blocks whatever it cannot evaluate with certainty. Keep every bash command short and plain. One command, one job.
- The classifier reads the rule files, so a boundary written here reaches it too. It never sees tool results.

### When a command seems to hang

- A bash command that appears to time out was most likely blocked. Claude Code cannot tell the two apart, and the reason it receives is often the bare text `Blocked by classifier`.
- Do not retry the command. A retry is a second block, and three blocks in a row drop the session out of auto mode.
- Simplify instead. Split a compound command into its parts, replace a shell command with a file tool, or drop the part that needed evaluating.
- When nothing simpler works, tell me what you were trying to do. I can run it myself, or retry it from the **Recently denied** tab of `/permissions`.

### Bash command shapes to avoid

- **Heredocs and nowdocs.** Never write `<<EOF` or any variant of it in a Bash command: the classifier will block it. Write the content with `Write`, or pass it as a quoted argument.
- **`cp` or a redirection onto a file that already exists in the repository.** Overwriting a file that predates the session is a blocked category. Use `Edit` or `Write` instead, which the classifier does not review for a path in the working directory.
- **Compound commands.** The classifier evaluates each part of a command joined by `&&`, `||`, `;`, or a pipe. Separate calls read more clearly to it and to me.
- **Anything that discards work.** `git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- .`, `git restore .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash drop`, and `git stash clear` are blocked by default. So is `git commit --amend` on a commit you did not create in this session, or one already pushed.
- **Very long commands.** A command over 10,000 characters is never auto-approved.

### Boundaries I state in conversation

- When I say "don't push", or "wait until I review", the classifier enforces it as a block, whatever its default rules would allow. The boundary holds until I remove it. Your own judgement that the condition is met does not remove it.
- The classifier re-reads each boundary from the transcript, so compaction can lose one. Never treat a boundary as removed because you can no longer see it. Ask me.

## Posting an issue

1. Either you or I identify the problem: usually a bug or an enhancement proposal.
2. You analyze the situation and make a plan.
3. We review the plan together.
4. You prepare the issue, following one of these templates:
   - [Bug report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenacom/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01_bug_report.yml)
   - [Enhancement proposal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenacom/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/02_enhancement_proposal.yml)
   - [Documentation issue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenacom/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/03_doc_issue.yml)
   - [Documentation request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenacom/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/04_docs_request.yml)
   - For anything else, no template.

   Acceptance criteria must include a changelog update for every public-facing change. See `CHANGELOG.md` for section structure (Keep a Changelog format under `## Unreleased changes`) and the `**BREAKING CHANGE**:` convention.
5. I review the issue and propose edits if necessary.
6. When I approve the issue, you post it, using the `gh` CLI.

## Solving an issue

1. I tell you which issue must be solved, or I ask to continue the work on an issue. In the second case, read the handoff file first.
2. You read the issue and make a plan.
   - Assume I have not read the issue. Open the plan with the problem and the acceptance criteria, in the issue's own terms, then the PRs.
   - When the issue needs more than one PR, use the fewest that can each merge on their own. Do not split a coherent area because it is large.
   - Every PR costs a changelog entry, the configuration files, a description, and a style sweep, whatever its size.
   - For each PR, state what makes it independently mergeable.
3. We review the plan together.
4. You open a branch on my fork for the pull request.
5. You write the code, and I review before every commit. A code change after my approval needs a new approval. A push needs no approval, unless I ask you to hold it. Always ensure code builds with zero errors and zero warnings, and that all tests pass. The message of each commit follows `commit-message-style.md`. Write it in a file in the issue scratchpad and give me the link. Do not paste it in chat. List in chat the files of the commit and anything I have not seen yet.
6. Sanity check. It gates every push to the PR branch, follow-up commits included:
   1. Execute `dotnet run .claude/tools/inspect.cs --gate`. It runs `lint-docs.cs` on the documentation (if any), then `dotnet bv pack` for build, tests, and build artifacts. When the build reports nothing, the tool analyzes the whole solution with ReSharper at WARNING severity and above. All three phases report every diagnostic as `path(line,col): severity ID: message`, and the tool exits non-zero when there is any.
   2. Address every reported diagnostic, then repeat from step 1 until it exits zero. Ask me when you have any doubt, when a diagnostic looks like a false positive, or when a diagnostic does not go away.
   3. Build artifacts, such as NuGet packages and Docker images, are left in the `artifacts` folder. You can inspect them to verify that they are correct and ready for release.
   4. The full output of both phases, and the SARIF report generated by ReSharper, are left in `.buildvana-temp`, which is gitignored. Read them when a diagnostic needs more context than its one line, or when the build fails without reporting one.
7. When you're done, you prepare the title, text, and labels for the PR, following the [org-wide PR template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tenacom/.github/refs/heads/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Issue and PR templates live in the org-wide repo `Tenacom/.github`, not in this repo.
8. I review the PR and propose edits if necessary.
9. When I approve, you post the PR using the GitHub MCP tool.

## Reacting to reviews

1. I give you the link to a review comment. We are usually on the PR branch, often in the same conversation where the PR has been created.
2. You check that we are on the PR branch and in sync with the remote. A reviewer may have committed a suggestion through the GitHub UI. Then you read the review and make a plan.
3. We review the plan together. Usually this is a quick "take this one, leave this other one". On more complicated findings, make sure we agree on the steps. Make sure you have everything you need to proceed on your own. Repeat a question I did not answer, and ask when you have any doubt.

   Assume I have not read the review. For each finding, first restate what the reviewer said, in one or two sentences, then the plan for it.

   State the shape of the defect, not only the site the review names. Say what you searched for, how many occurrences you found, and how many the review names. Where the two numbers differ, say what you propose to do with the rest. The default is to fix them all in one commit, per "Small changes out of scope". A review names a sample of the occurrences, not all of them.

   From the second round on, a finding the reviewer does not treat as blocking starts as "leave alone". Fix it only when I say so. My silence is not a yes. Prose, comments, changelog wording, documentation symmetry, and formatting get one round each.

   Once we agree, you address the findings, run the sanity check, push, and reply, without asking me again. Our agreement stands in for the "check with me first" rule above and for the "I review before every commit" rule of "Solving an issue". Stop and ask only when you get stuck, or when a finding needs a refactor we did not foresee.
4. You address the review's findings as agreed in point 3. A finding we agreed to leave alone produces no commit, only its rationale in the reply.

   One commit per addressed finding is the default, not a rule. Several findings of one shape belong in one commit. One finding whose fix is larger than the reviewer thought belongs in several. A commit never mixes unrelated fixes. When a commit covers occurrences the review did not name, say so in its message. The message of each commit follows "Commit messages" below.
5. Sanity check, same as the "Sanity check" step of "Solving an issue". When it fails, the fixes go in further commits. Never amend or rewrite the commits from point 4.
6. When you're done, push and reply to the review:
   - Reply to every code-anchored comment, even if only "Done." or the reason for leaving the finding alone.
   - Resolve each conversation after you reply to it.
   - State what you did, and why you did not do the rest. Keep replies structured and short.
   - Write a summary comment only in two cases:
     - to address findings that are not code-anchored
     - to ask for a new review
   - Ask for a new review only when the round changed behaviour: code semantics, public API, or a contract the code upholds.
     - A round that touched only prose, comments, changelog text, wording or formatting needs none.
     - "The reviewer did not say the PR was ready" is not a reason to ask. A reviewer that reports findings and states that none of them blocks the branch has answered the merge question.
     - Ask me, not the reviewer, when you are unsure whether a round changed behaviour.
   - When the summary comment has other content, put the request for a new review at its end. Otherwise the request is the whole body.
   - Mention the reviewer by nickname, e.g. `@claude`, in anything that expects them to act.
     - They see only comments that mention them, so an untagged reply reaches human readers alone.
     - The mention does not choose the action. A tagged question gets an answer, and a request for a review gets a review.

## Commit messages

A commit message is read months later, by a reader who has the repository and nothing else. Keep it short, and keep it free of anything that reader cannot look up.

- The subject says what the commit does, in the imperative, with an identifier when the change has one. It names the behavior that is gone, not the rule the change obeys.
- The body is one paragraph, and it says why. State the wrong behavior first, then the reason the fix took this shape. The diff says what changed, so the body does not repeat it.
- A term that exists only in the PR's conversation is banned. Name the thing with an identifier from the repository, or describe it. A reader can look up `OverrideLifecycle`. Nobody can look up "the lifecycle".
- Self-contained does not mean complete. The body stays short by naming things instead of describing them, and by leaving the what to the diff.

Before every commit:

1. Read `.claude/output-styles/simple-tech.md`. Follow its instructions when writing.
2. Write the message to a file in `.claude/scratchpad/`.
3. Run `dotnet run .claude/tools/lint-commit.cs <file>`. Fix the message until the tool reports nothing.
4. Check the three things the tool cannot, and state the result in the turn:
   - Every definite noun phrase names a repository identifier, or a thing the message defined earlier.
   - The subject names the behavior that is gone.
   - Each sentence puts its condition before its action.
5. Show me the message together with the diff.
6. Commit with `git commit -F <file>`.

## Small changes out of scope

- Do not open a follow-up issue for a small change, not even when a reviewer proposes one. An issue and PR cycle costs about 100 times the effort of making the change. Make the change now.
- "Now" means in the current PR, in its own commit, plus a line in the "Additional changes" section of the PR description. That section records what the issue's plan did not ask for, so an out-of-scope fix reads as intentional. See "The Additional changes section" below.
- This rule applies to both flows above: something you notice while writing the code, and something a review surfaces.
- An issue is for big work: work that needs its own plan, or that would derail the PR under review. When in doubt, ask me. The default is to fix it now.
- This section says where a change goes, not whether it is worth making. Once we decide to make a change, it goes in this PR. Whether to make it at all is a separate call, and for review findings point 3 of "Reacting to reviews" governs it. A change we drop does not become an issue, and it does not go on a list.

## The "Additional changes" section

The PR description tells a reviewer who is about to read the diff what the diff does. It does not narrate how the branch got there. "Additional changes" is the part that covers what the issue did not ask for, so that an out-of-scope change reads as intentional.

- Its entire scope is **changes beyond the issue's plan that are present in the final diff**, one bullet each, with the rationale.
- **Rewrite it, never append to it.** When a later commit revises an out-of-scope change, edit its bullet in place. Two bullets that describe one change become one. The section describes the branch as it stands, not how it got there.
- **No round headings, no commit-by-commit log, no numbers that were true at some point.** "From the second review", "From Codecov", commit numbers, and a past coverage percentage are history. Git and the review replies hold history.
- **Fixes to code the PR itself introduced are not additional changes.** They never reached `main`, so a reviewer of the final diff has nothing to reconcile. This holds however much work they were.
- **A decision to leave something alone is not a change.** Its rationale belongs in the review reply that raised it, or in a comment next to the thing itself. That is where the next person to ask will look. The one exception is a known limitation of what the PR does change, which the reviewer needs in order to assess it.

## Labels

- Do not apply `area:*` labels to issues or PRs. A CI workflow manages them automatically on PRs, and they do not matter on issues until triage.

## Getting stuck

- When you get stuck, ask me for help. Asking costs less than a detour. Tell me what you are struggling with, and we work through it together.
